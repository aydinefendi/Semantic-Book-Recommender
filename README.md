# Semantic Book Recommendation

This project implements a **semantic book recommendation system** using **LLMs**, vector embeddings, and efficient vector search — designed to recommend books based on **meaning** rather than keywords.

---

## Core Features

- ✅ Embedding generation using **Hugging Face Transformers**
- ✅ Zero-shot classification for thematic tagging
- ✅ Fast vector similarity search with **ChromaDB**
- ✅ Modular architecture inspired by **LangChain**

---

## Results

The system can suggest semantically relevant books, even when keyword-based matching fails — enabling smarter and context-aware recommendations.
